This has succeeded in building his keen knowledge of user experience, technical capabilities, interaction design, and concept generation. Further studies in material anthropology and human behavior also piqued his interest in the way human beings interact with objects in their daily lives, and what those objects mean to them on an emotional level. Marc's approach to problem solving is rooted in these interactions, and the knowledge that people desire products that are both beautiful and packed with utility.</span></div>
